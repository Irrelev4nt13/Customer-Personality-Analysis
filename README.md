# Customer-Personality-Analysis
ðŸ“ŠCustomer Personality Analysis, using various Data Mining techniques and Machine Learning algorithms.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to get familiar with the basic stages of the process of implementing data mining techniques, namely: pre-processing / cleaning, transformation, application of data mining techniques and evaluation. The implementation will be done in Python programming language using the tools/libraries: jupyter notebook, pandas and SciKit Learn.

## Description
Customer Personality Analysis involves thoroughly examining the optimal clientele for a company. It aids in enhancing a company's comprehension of its clientele and streamlines product adjustments to cater to the distinct requirements, behaviors, and concerns of various customer categories.

## Tasks

### Preprocessing / Cleaning
* Check for missing values in the data and handle them appropriately.
* Convert columns related to dates to DateTime objects for easier manipulation.
* Encode categorical attributes to numeric values for analysis.
* Utilize existing features to create new columns for a clearer understanding of the data.
* Visualize the data using plots to gain insights into customer attributes and distributions.

### Correlation Study
* Examine the correlation between different features using heatmap diagrams.
* Use histograms and scatter plots to identify relationships between features.
* Analyze the results to extract useful information about customer behavior and preferences.

### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
* Reduce the dimensionality of the data while retaining as much variance as possible.
* Perform PCA to extract three principal components.
* Visualize the outcome in a 3D plot to gain insights into the structure of the data.

### Clustering
* Utilize the ELBOW method to determine the optimal number of clusters.
* Implement clustering algorithms such as K-means and Agglomerative clustering.
* Display the formed clusters using scatter plots to visualize customer segments.
